# PetalCraft

“PetalCraft” is a fully fledged e-commerce mobile application for ordering flower decorations. The users can 
select any preferred type from a range of different flowers provided, and also select from a selection of 
exquisite floral arrangements, tailored to elevate various occasions. Thus the users will be able to match their 
floral selections to specific preferences or event themes, giving them a more personalized touch. They can 
find the perfect arrangement for birthdays, weddings, or heartfelt gestures. The application will consist of an 
intuitive interface, allowing users to effortlessly navigate through a diverse array of bouquets and flowers to 
place orders with ease. The application also ensures secure transactions. 

## Scope  
 
Our Flower Ordering Application is very much similar to other ordering applications but, there is a 
considerable scope for our project. The administrative portal, which implies a dedicated platform for the 
administrators to manage and oversee the application is absent in this application. And also, there is no 
payment gateway which facilitates the users to make financial transactions for the orders they place, directly 
within the app. Moreover, the users are not receiving real-time updates or alerts via text messages. These 
aspects can be considered in the future for future developments, which would enrich the mobile application 
experience for the users.
